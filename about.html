				<p>Hello! My name is DragonDreamer! Thank you for visiting my website!</p>
				<p>I'm not really sure what My current goals are, but I aspire to one day be a video game developer and have published at least one game! 
					I used to be in college for programming, but am currently not taking any courses. I still hope to graduate one day, if I can go back.
				</p>
				<p>I've always liked imagining worlds and thinking of stories, and video games are the perfect combination of medias to allow oneself to immerse themselves in one.
					Although, there is a lot that goes into making one, and I don't yet have a lot of the skills needed. I am still hopeful to push through and suceed in bringing
					my ideas to life one day!
				</p>
				
				
				<p>I also sometimes sketch in my spare time! I'm going to be posting it here if I think it's good enough.  
					It's mostly just pencil sketches for now, maybe digital art in the future if I ever invest in a drawing tablet.
				</p>
				<p>I usually play a lot of video games, honestly a bit too much lol. I've been really invested in OverWatch for a long time, but to be honest I might swap to another game soon.</p>
				<p>Or maybe I should give up on video games entirely. Would probably be beneficial.</p>
				
				
				<!--<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 150%;">---About me---</p>
				<p>I'm just you're average Dragon, doing his best tell stories and inspire people to do their best as well to make the world a better place!</p>
				<p>I also am a programming student and aspiring game developer! Although I've yet to make an actual complete game I am working towards it!!</p>
				<p> I'll probably have the game available here to play somehow once it's reached completion </p>

				<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 150%;">---My Content---</p>
			
				<p>I'll primarily be creating gaming videos on my Youtube channel. The games I usually play are a varity of different genres and types.</p>
				<p>Admittedly, the games I play on my off time I can't record or stream due to my current computer's limits, so it'll mostly be smaller games that are easier for my system to handle.</p>
			
				<p>I'm also working towards uploading various programming series, which will be small tutorial series about creating the various games that I'm creating in order to become a better programmer and game developer.</p>
