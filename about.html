				<p>I'm just you're average Dragon, doing his best tell stories and inspire people to do their best as well to make the world a better place!</p>
				<p>I also am a programming student and aspiring game developer! Although I've yet to make an actual complete game I am working towards it!!</p>
				<p> I'll probably have the game available here to play somehow once it's reached completion </p>

				<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 150%;">---My Content---</p>
			
				<p>I'll primarily be creating gaming videos on my Youtube channel. The games I usually play are a varity of different genres and types.</p>
				<p>Admittedly, the games I play on my off time I can't record or stream due to my current computer's limits, so it'll mostly be smaller games that are easier for my system to handle.</p>
			
				<p>I'm also working towards uploading various programming series, which will be small tutorial series about creating the various games that I'm creating in order to become a better programmer and game developer.</p>
